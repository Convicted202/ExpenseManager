##Contributing Start Guide

In order to do smth you need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

-----

To load all dev depencies needed for development type in terminal/cmd

```
npm install
```
without any additional arguments.
This will install Grunt and all required modules.

To start coding type in terminal/cmd
```
grunt
```
This will start local server, and start watching for any changes in .less files to compile output css,
I will add JS Hint live hinting soon.

Now when Grunt is running open your browser and navigatte to

```
http://localhost:9090
```

At that stage to generate some random test data, open brower console and type
```
GenerateData( integer );
```
This will generate some test expenses.

That's it, now play around with it.
